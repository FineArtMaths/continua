	This is part of \href{https://github.com/FineArtMaths/continua}{the continua project}. The project is broken down into `modules', each covering a specific topic. Each module ultimately becomes one of more courses. The approach is:
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item{Identify a topic that should be its own module (this is recorded in the `overview' documents in each main folder)}
		\item{Create a `notes' document assembling the technical material for each module in a fairly condensed form, but with some indication of how the pedagogy might go (that's what you're looking at now)}
		\item{Create one or more coursebooks that contain the technical material along with motivation, philosophical reflections, pictures, examples, intuitive explanations and so on.}
	\end{itemize}
	
	When the coursebooks are complete, the notes document is no longer needed and will probably be deleted. So the fact that you're looking at this means this is a work in progress -- it is incomplete, disorganised and probably full of errors.
	
	\part{Introduction to Differential Topology}
	
	\chapter{Transversailty and Intersection}
		G\&P Ch 2, but maybe also include Sard's Theorem from Ch 1
	
	\chapter{Oriented Intersection Theory}
		G\&P Ch 3
	
	\chapter{Morse Functions}
		Nicolaescu Ch 1
	
	\chapter{Hamiltonian Flows}
		Nicolaescu Ch 3 -- I'd like to do this here before getting into the theory, which might mean we do the setup here and use it to motivate and illustrate what comes next. Note that we have a date with sympleptic manifolds on the Riemannian Geometry course and it's possible we need the extra machinery from that to do justice to this topic.

	\chapter{Surgery Theory}
		Nicolaescu Ch 2
	
	\chapter{The $h$-Cobordism Theorem}
		Kosinski ch 7 and 8 may be helpful

	\chapter{Morseâ€“Floer Homology}
		Nicolaescu Ch 2
