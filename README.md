# continua

:warning: **WARNING** :warning:: Until this warning is removed, this project is at an early stage and all documents are (a) incoomplete and (b) unchecked for errors. There is probably nothing useful here yet!

This project consists of a developing set of notes towards a curriculum of modern maths for curious adults. The goal is to produce a set of interlinked resources that are suitable for self-study or as the basis of courses. They come out of my long-standing educational practice in universities, art schools, adult education colleges and elsewhere.

The organization of this project is likely to undergo many changes but the topics I currently intend to cover fall into two three main groups, each of which has its own folder in this project.

## Continuity

The backbone of this projects is an "alternative calculus sequence" that I expect to look something like this:

* Point-free topology as an account of continua in the spirit of Aristotle;
* Algebraic topology with the main focus on homology;
* Differential geometry with the "locally ringed space" approach;
* Differential topology with an emphasis on Morse theory;
* Riemannian geometry developed in a harmonious way with the rest.

I hope demostrate practically that advanced mathematics can be taught with the following philosophical guidelines:

* The idea of a continuum does not depend on any prior idea of a "point";
* Most mathematical objects of interest to us are constructive;
* There should be a consistent theory of continua that works in all finite dimensions.

However, in all of the above I will not insist on logical rigour; where necessary I will make use of choice functions, the excluded middle and so on. My primary interest is in pedagogy rather than philosophy.

## Algebra

This is the study of structures that arise naturally while trying to work with other mathematical objects as well as in a wide variety of practical situations. While I want to keep my focus on the previous theme, these subjects have enough intrinsic interest to be worth developing in a bit more detail than strictly necessary. They include:

* Group theory, especially its connection with symmetry and therefore geometry;
* Linear algebra, which I like to teach in a rather abstract manner, emphasising tensor products;
* Homological algebra, which is an indispensible toolkit in the study of continuous space;
* Galois theory, which I'm inclined to treat in the context of noncommutative algebra;
* Lie groups, representation theory and group cohomology, which can be seen as both an application of our understanding of continua and a means to extend it;
* Hopf algebras, examples of which appear at the core of the theory of continuous phenomena.

I will also probably develop a very minimal survey course in abstract algebra for folks who don't want ot fuss with all these topics but need some of the language of groups, rings, vector spaces and so on to understand the material about continuity.

## Other Topics

These are lower-priority topics I have an interest in, and have taught to various degrees, that don't fit into the main story. They include probability, statistics and financial maths, which are all one way or another underpinned by measure theory. Because of this common root, these topics may organise themselves into something more substantial in time, but for now this is a place to park things I don't want to be distracted by for now.
