# continua

:warning: **WARNING** :warning:

This project is at a very early stage and all documents are (a) incomplete and (b) unchecked for errors. There's probably nothing useful here yet beyond this README.

This project consists of a developing set of notes towards a curriculum of modern maths for curious adults. The goal is to produce a set of interlinked resources that are suitable for self-study or as the basis of courses. They come out of my long-standing educational practice in universities, art schools, adult education colleges and elsewhere. The needs of adults who have no mathematical background are, effectively, not being met anywhere anyway so this project should not be understood as a criticism of what anyone is already doing. In particular, I literally have no opinion on how best to educate future mathematicians, physicists, engineers and so on. Also note that this is a programme of courses (or self-study modules) for determined, sophisticated adults who lack any formal training in maths; although I think school maths curricula are in dire need of reform, that's not what this project is about.

The organization of this project is likely to undergo many changes but the topics I currently intend to cover fall into two three main groups, each of which has its own folder in this repo.

## Continuity

The backbone of this project is an "alternative calculus sequence" that I expect to look something like this:

* Point-free topology as an account of continua in the spirit of Aristotle;
* Algebraic topology with the main focus on (co)homology as a technique for measuring "the gap between ought and is";
* Differential geometry with the "locally ringed space" approach, making much use of sheaves as ways to "turn local data into global information";
* Differential topology as a first application of the above, probably with an emphasis on Morse theory;
* Riemannian geometry as a second and much "heavier" and more classical application, with a view to trying to show off all the usual machinery.

I hope demonstrate practically that advanced mathematics can be taught with the following philosophical guidelines:

* The continua needed by geometry can be presented without any prior idea of a "point";
* Most mathematical objects of interest to us are constructive;
* You can teach a consistent version of the calculus that works in all finite dimensions from the beginning.

However, in all of the above I will not insist on logical rigour; where necessary I will make use of choice functions, the excluded middle and so on. My primary interest is in pedagogy rather than philosophy.

## Structure

This is where abstract algebra goes, which we take to be the study of structures that arise naturally while trying to work with other mathematical objects as well as in a wide variety of practical situations. While I want to keep my focus on the previous theme, these subjects have enough intrinsic interest to be worth developing in a bit more detail than strictly necessary. They include:

* Group theory, especially its connection with symmetry and therefore geometry;
* Linear algebra, which for a long time I've had good luck teaching in a rather abstract manner, emphasising tensor products;
* Homological algebra, which is an indispensible toolkit in the study of continuous space (and elsewhere);
* Galois theory, which I'm inclined to treat in the context of noncommutative algebra; the key theme is extension problems and the obstructions to solving them;
* Lie groups, representation theory and group cohomology, which can be seen as both an application of our understanding of continua and a means to extend it;
* Hopf algebras, examples of which appear at the core of the theory of continuous phenomena.

I will also probably develop a very minimal survey course in abstract algebra for folks who don't want ot fuss with all these topics but need some of the language of groups, rings, vector spaces and so on to understand the material about continuity.

## Measure

These are lower-priority topics I have an interest in, and have taught to various degrees, that don't fit into the main story. They include 

* Probability
* Statistics 
* Financial maths

which are all underpinned by measure theory. Because of this common root, these topics may organise themselves into something more substantial in time. They might also end up being cut from the project as the first two sections grow horribly out of control.
