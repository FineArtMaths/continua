# continua

:warning: **WARNING** :warning:

This project is at a very early stage and any documents you may find here are likely to be incomplete and full of errors. There's probably nothing useful here yet beyond this page.

This repo aims to become a broad and innovative modern maths curriculum. The target audience is adults who are motivated (or just determined) but have no formal training in maths beyond high school. The goal is to produce a set of interlinked resources that are suitable for self-study or as the basis of courses. They come out of my long-standing educational practice in universities, art schools, adult education colleges and elsewhere. 

The needs of adults with no mathematical background are, effectively, not being met anywhere anyway so none of this should not be understood as a criticism of what anyone is already doing. In particular, I literally have no opinion on how best to educate future mathematicians, physicists, engineers and so on. And although I think school maths curricula are in dire need of reform, that's not what this project is about.

## Continuity

The backbone is an "alternative calculus sequence" that I expect to look something like this:

* Point-free topology as an account of continua in the spirit of Aristotle;
* Algebraic topology with the main focus on (co)homology as a generalizable technique for measuring "the gap between ought and is";
* Differential geometry with the "locally ringed space" approach, making much use of sheaves as the most natural way to "turn local data into global information";
* Differential topology as a first application of the above, probably with an emphasis on Morse theory;
* Riemannian geometry as a more classical application, with a view to trying to show off all the usual machinery. 

## Structure

Abstract algebra studies those structures that arise repeatedly while working with other mathematical objects. While I want to keep my focus on the previous theme, these subjects have enough intrinsic interest to be worth developing in a bit more detail than strictly necessary. They include:

* Group theory, especially its connection with symmetry and therefore geometry;
* Linear algebra, which for a long time I've had good luck teaching by emphasising tensor products;
* Homological algebra, an indispensible toolkit in the study of continuity (and elsewhere);
* Galois theory, whose key theme is extension problems and the obstructions to solving them;
* Lie groups, representation theory and group cohomology, which can be seen as both an application of our understanding of continua and a means to extend it;
* Hopf algebras, examples of which appear at the core of the theory of continua.

I will also probably develop a very minimal survey course in abstract algebra for folks who don't want to fuss with all these topics but need some of the language of groups, rings, vector spaces and so on to understand the material about continuity.

## Measure

These are lower-priority topics I have an interest in, and have taught to various degrees, that don't fit into the main story. They include 

* Probability
* Statistics 
* Financial maths

which are all underpinned by measure theory. Because of this common root, these topics may organise themselves into something more substantial in time. They might also end up being cut from the project as the first two sections grow horribly out of control.
